Successfully adapted OpenWrt to add Morse support.

If you've run scripts/feeds install -p morse -a, you should now be able
to add the following package via make menuconfig:
  netifd-morse  (uci support for type morse devices)

This will pull in all necessary packages as dependencies,
including the morse kernel module and adapted hostapd/wpa_supplicant.

You probably want to commit these changes to a branch. Use git status to
see which files have been added or changed. For more information, see:
  feeds/morse/README.md
